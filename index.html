                        <p class="lead">Hello! My name is Sara Ahmed. I am a digital media major at UCF. I am 23 years old this year. I enjoy reading and playing games. 
                            When it comes to goals for my future, I hope to be a part of a development team of any kind. Whether it be in the game industry
                            to web development, my interest can go either way. When it comes to working in a team, I consider myself a team leader and someone who 
                            is open minded. My motto in life is "Go with the flow".

                            as the focus on this project was getting the exercise app to work.

                            functions such as the timer and the rep counter, it is more stylized
                            than the previous one.

                            The user would answer the questions and find out the results of the question would be
                            displayed at the end of the quiz.

                        <p class="lead">This is a design tie-in for the exercise app. This design is focusing on what the app 
                            would look like and how the functions such as the timer and rep counter would look in 
                            an app setting.

                        <p class="lead">This is an updated version of the exercise app. What was added was a gps map and an 
                            addition to add weights for exercise resistense. Not only that, but biking was added
                            as another exercise option.

                        <h2>TODO App Design</h2>
                        <p class="lead">This design is made as a to-do app on an android phone. This app would allow you to 
                            make to-do lists from creating them to editing them. There is also an addition of a login/registration 
                            page to the app as well. I added cats because I enjoy cats and think it would be a funny edition to this.
